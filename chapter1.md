## [1.1] **Definitions for Digital Signals**

Elecronic circuits and systems can be conveniently divided into two board catagories generally referred to as analog and digital circuits. Analog circuits are designed for use with small signals while digital circuits are generally used wuth large signals. An op-amp with a voltage gain of 5 is an analog circuit. A remote control circuit that switches the lights in a parking area on after sunset and turns them off at sunrise is an example of a digital circut.

Any quantity that changes with time eiter can be represented as an analog signal or it can be treated as a digital signal. For example, let's apply heat to a container of water and record the temperature over a period of time. In fig.(a), the temperature is recorded continuously, and it changes smoothly from $20^{0}C$ to 80^0C.
